# OffSecGym

OffSecGym is a research platform for studying autonomous security agents in isolated,
synthetic cyber ranges. The range and evaluation infrastructure are the core product;
models and orchestration strategies are interchangeable subjects of study.

Licensed under Apache-2.0; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Milestone 0 establishes versioned contracts, an append-only event store, a CLI skeleton,
architecture documentation, and tests. It does not start a range or call a model.

## Development

Use Python 3.12 or newer (below 3.15). With `uv`:

```sh
uv sync --extra dev
uv run offsecgym --help
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
```

Validate a versioned YAML spec with `offsecgym spec validate PATH`. The range lifecycle
commands arrive in Milestone 1 and currently return an explicit unavailable error.

PostgreSQL integration tests require `OFFSECGYM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to point to an
isolated, disposable database. Apply `alembic upgrade head` before running them.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [safety](docs/safety.md), and
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md).
